"Super-resolution in connection with video compression in double-task neural network". Purpose of this work is to find connections and dependencies between video super-resolution task and video compression task.
To do it, I asked myself questions like "These tasks are fullfiling each other or are orthogonal?", "How first task influence the other task?".
